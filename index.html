    <h1>My Apology to Arpita</h1>

    <h2>Realization and Regret</h2>
    <p>Arpita, my love, I know I have hurt you deeply, and I have spent a lot of time reflecting upon my actions. I am filled with regret and shame because of my behaviour. I know I have said and done a lot of hurtful things. Things that make me disgusted of myself when I look back at it. I have been an absolute fucking idiot. I've hurt you countless times over the last month. I've hurt you and broken your heart. And you've tried to warn me about my mistakes and I've taken them for granted. I have made empty promises saying I will not hurt you or make you cry again. I have broken those promises.</p>

    <h2>Admitting My Mistakes</h2>
    <p>I have been a terrible boyfriend for the last month. I know my actions have been controlling and very hurtful. I have repeated my mistakes so many times despite your pleas. You deserved none of it. I have shifted blame onto you and made you feel uncomfortable in being with me. The day I did not text you for the entire day was completely wrong to happen to you. I have made undeserving taunts and rebukes onto you.</p>

    <p>You are right to act the way you have done Arpita. You deserved to be treated correctly. Unlike how I have been for the last month. You are right not to trust my words when you read this. I take full accountability for my actions Arpita.</p>

    <h2>Praising You</h2>
    <p>You are an amazing woman whose love I have misused in the past month very badly. You are an absolute angel. So strong and clever. Really the most graceful and thoughtful woman. I really hate myself when I see the look of absolute pain on your face when you see me. It makes my blood boil with anger upon myself. You are so lovely. So perfect. I just cannot think of the sheer suffering you've been through yesterday. You have told me of the horror I have put you through. I wish I could do anything in the world to just make the day undone. But I also know what has been done now, cannot be undone, and the pain you have been through cannot be reversed. It is too severe a crime for you to ignore like you have let for all the previous times.</p>

    <h2>Taking Full Responsibility</h2>
    <p>I am taking responsibility for all the things that I have done to you for which you have rightfully taken strong decisions about our relationship. I know no amount of words I say will be enough to even come close to restore your faith. What has happened is too severe to be fixed by my words. I have traumatized you and acted so condescending that no words can fix. You have done so many things for me, I cannot sum it up in a finite amount of time. All the days you've been there for me, forgiven my mistakes, silently suffered while I was relentless on you. There is no world where I would ever find someone so capable and caring as you. I have misused your love and trust Arpita. I acknowledge and agree with every single instance of hurt you have felt because of me. Your eyes so red, your face so drooped, I have been a really bad human being in the last few weeks.</p>

    <h2>Apology</h2>
    <p>I know that a simple sorry will not make up for the mistakes that I have repeated. But I will apologize. I apologise for everything that I have done to hurt you. I have not been thinking straight to manipulate you so badly. I am so so sorry for everything Arpita. Your decision for our relationship is not wrong.</p>

    <h2>Request for Reconsideration</h2>
    <p>However, Arpita, I request you, I request you and I beg you, to please reconsider and rethink. I know it's very difficult to believe me and my words. But I am still the same person underneath. I am the same person you fell in love with. We have spent the better part of this year together. Those have been the happiest I have been in my life. 31st March marked a chapter of my life where I was the happiest person in the world. When you are with me Arpita, everything sings. Everything is so colorful, and beautiful. You truly make me happy Arpita. And I have done everything in my power to keep you happy too. I have always given maximum efforts towards you and towards us. I have never skimped out on anything. Your happiness has always been my utmost priority.</p>

    <h2>Promise to Change</h2>
    <p>For the last few weeks I have acted very wrong Arpita, but I know I will improve my behaviour. I will never act out of line Arpita, you will not feel any thing other than love from me. And I will do it willingly. I will do it willingly because I value you so much. You are the only woman in my life, and I have always loved you so dearly. I know you do not trust my words anymore. I just request you, to take a leap of faith one last time, for all the love we have for each other. You will find the boy you fell in love with. There will never be anyone else that you will see in me. I know this is very difficult to do for you, but you have my word Arpita, this will be the last time you'll have to feel this way towards me. From here there will be the relationship you deserved. It broke me when you said you regretted meeting me, and I will do everything I can to change your outlook towards me.</p>

    <p>I will make everything right. I will give my best efforts to fix everything and treat you right. All I ask of you is to please consider giving the boy you love one last chance. The last one in a long line of chances I have wasted and taken lightly. I request you to stay one last time. Please take this leap of faith. I know you will not be able to see me the way you used to, but I want to show you I can change. I can be the person you trusted and loved. I love you so much Arpita, and I want to show it to you through my actions and efforts. Apologies will not be enough to make up for the pain you have gone through because of me, but I will show you that I can improve through my acts. I know it's difficult for you to trust me right now, but I want to show you through consistent efforts that I can be better. Words alone cannot mend what has been broken, but I will mend it in gold, through the deeds. I will give you the life you chose when you got together with me, a life that you rightfully deserve. I will work on rebuilding what we had, and creating a relationship based on love, trust and respect.</p>
