                <h1>Arpita, My Love</h1>

        <p>I know I have hurt you deeply, and I have spent a lot of time reflecting upon my actions. I am filled with regret and shame because of my behaviour.</p>

        <p>I know I have said and done a lot of hurtful thingsâ€”things that make me disgusted with myself when I look back. I have been an absolute fool. I've hurt you countless times over the last month, and you've tried to warn me about my mistakes, but I took them for granted.</p>

        <p>I have made empty promises saying I would not hurt you or make you cry again. I have broken those promises. I have been a terrible boyfriend for the last month.</p>

        <h2>Acknowledging My Mistakes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I have been controlling and hurtful.</li>
            <li>I have repeated my mistakes despite your pleas.</li>
            <li>I have shifted blame onto you and made you feel uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>The day I did not text you was completely wrong.</li>
            <li>I have made undeserving taunts and rebukes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are right to act the way you have. You deserved to be treated correctly. Unlike how I have been for the last month.</p>
        <p>I take full accountability for my actions, Arpita.</p>

        <h2>About You</h2>
        <p>You are an amazing woman whose love I have misused very badly. You are an absolute angelâ€”strong, clever, graceful, and thoughtful.</p>
        <p>I hate myself when I see the pain I have caused you. You are so lovely, so perfect. I cannot fathom the suffering I have put you through.</p>
        <p>I wish I could undo the pain, but I know that what has been done cannot be reversed. The hurt I caused is too severe for words alone to repair.</p>

        <h2>My Apology</h2>
        <p>I know that saying <span class="highlight">"sorry"</span> is not enough. But I will say it anyway:</p>
        <p class="highlight">I am truly, deeply sorry for everything, Arpita.</p>
        <p>I apologize for hurting you, for manipulating your trust, and for failing as a partner.</p>
        <p>Your decision about our relationship is not wrong. You have every right to take the steps you need.</p>

        <h2>A Request for a Last Chance</h2>
        <p>However, Arpita, I requestâ€”and begâ€”you to reconsider.</p>
        <p>I am still the same person you fell in love with. The time we have spent together has been the happiest of my life. Being with you makes everything colorful and beautiful. You truly make me happy.</p>
        <p>I have always given my maximum effort for you and for us. Your happiness has always been my utmost priority.</p>
        <p>I know I have acted wrongly in the last few weeks, but I promise to change. I will never make you feel anything other than love. I will do it willingly because I value you so much.</p>
        <p>All I ask is that you take one last leap of faithâ€”for all the love we share. You will find the boy you fell in love with. I promise there will never be anyone else.</p>
        <p>From now on, I will build the relationship you deserve. I want to show you through consistent actions that I can be better. Words cannot mend what has been broken, but I will mend it through deeds.</p>

        <h2>My Commitment</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Improve my behavior.</li>
            <li>Respect you, love you, and care for you always.</li>
            <li>Rebuild trust through consistent effort.</li>
            <li>Give you the life you rightfully deserve.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>With Hope and Love</h2>
